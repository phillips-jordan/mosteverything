Rewrite this program so that it doesn't have a single function definition
In other words, replace all the function definitions with anonymous functions
The final program should be on a single line


var greet = function (x) {console.log("hello " + x);}

var call = function (f) {f("bob");}

call(greet);





((function (f) {f("bob");})(function (x) {console.log("hello " + x);}))
